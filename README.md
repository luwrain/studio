## LUWRAIN Studio: integrated development environment (IDE)

This repository contains integrated development environment (IDE) designed for using by the blind.
It's based on [LUWRAIN](https://github.com/luwrain/luwrain/) and at the early stage of its evolution.
In the future it is supposed to be suitable for development tasks on Java, C++ and JavaScript.
This list, likely, will be extended depending on the requests which we can get.
We would like to make it suitable especially for the beginners,
because the first steps usually are the most difficult.
